# Project Description

Portfolio built with **HTML, CSS/SASS, MATERIALIZE, and JAVASCRIPT**, containing my contact information, academic background, projects, and other details so that interested individuals can access and view it. This OnePage portfolio consists of four sections:

- **Home:** Section with a photo, links to social media, and access to download the CV.  
- **About:** Includes personal and academic information.  
- **Technologies:** Section showcasing the technologies and programming languages I have an intermediate to advanced level of proficiency in. Technologies in which I have basic knowledge are not included here but are listed in my CV.

It also includes the use of **Animate CSS** for animations, accompanied by **wow.js** for their functionalities.
